I have been storing all of the "bigger" homework projects I've done for this Coursera certification in one giant repo to make them easier to separate from my "real" projects. However, this of course makes sharing this project for peer review much harder. One of the capstone course's earliest exercises called for creating a repo just for the project and luckily, I had not deleted that repo yet even though I also hadn't doen anything with it (because the project was in the giant "homework" repo), so I copied all of the files from the "homework" repo here so that you can check them out without having to clone three other big projects.
